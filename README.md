Self-healing security automation for Python projects using Safety CLI. This GitHub Action automatically scans your Python dependencies for vulnerabilities, creates GitHub issues for detected CVEs, and assigns them to GitHub Copilot for AI-powered remediation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Runs Safety CLI to detect vulnerabilities in Python dependencies
- **Intelligent Issue Creation**: Automatically creates detailed GitHub issues for each vulnerability
- **AI-Powered Remediation**: Assigns issues to GitHub Copilot for automated security fixes
- **Severity Filtering**: Configurable severity threshold to focus on critical issues
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing issues before creating new ones
- **Rich Context**: Includes CVE details, severity levels, and recommended fixes
- - **Intelligent Assignment**: Automatically detects Copilot availability and falls back to human assignees

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python project with `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`
- GitHub repository with Issues enabled
- GitHub Copilot enabled on your repository (optional but recommended)

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Example

Add this to your `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

```yaml
name: Security Self-Healing

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Run weekly on Mondays
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggers
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run SafetyCLI Self-Healing Action
        uses: kmesiab/safetycli-self-healing-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
name: Advanced Security Self-Healing

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Run daily
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run SafetyCLI Self-Healing Action
        uses: kmesiab/safetycli-self-healing-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          safety_api_key: ${{ secrets.SAFETY_API_KEY }}
          copilot_agent: 'copilot'
          project_path: './src'
          severity_threshold: 'high'
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

          assign_to_copilot: 'true'
### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| `github_token` | GitHub token for creating issues and PRs | Yes | - |
| `safety_api_key` | Safety CLI API key for enhanced scanning | No | - |
| `copilot_agent` | GitHub Copilot agent username to assign issues | No | `copilot` |
| `project_path` | Path to Python project to scan | No | `.` |
| `severity_threshold` | Minimum severity: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` | No | `medium` |
| `assign_to_copilot` | Enable/disable Copilot assignment (true/false) | No | `true` |
| `fallback_assignee` | Fallback GitHub username if Copilot assignment fails | No | `''` (empty) |

### Safety API Key

While not required, using a Safety API key provides:

- More detailed vulnerability information
- Higher rate limits
- Access to premium vulnerability database

Get your API key from [Safety CLI](https://safetycli.com/) and add it as a repository secret.

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Scan**: The action runs Safety CLI on your Python project
2. **Analyze**: Parses vulnerability report and filters by severity
3. **Create Issues**: For each vulnerability:
   - Creates a detailed GitHub issue with CVE information
   - Includes package name, version, severity, and description
   - Adds appropriate labels (security, dependencies, priority)
4. **Assign to Copilot**: Automatically assigns the issue to GitHub Copilot
5. **AI Remediation**: Copilot analyzes the issue and creates a PR with fixes

6. ## 🔍 Copilot Detection & Fallback

The action includes intelligent Copilot detection to ensure issues are properly assigned:

### How It Works

1. **Copilot Detection**: Before assigning issues, the action checks if GitHub Copilot is available in your repository by:
   - Querying the GitHub API for available assignees
   - Verifying the configured `copilot_agent` username exists
   
2. **Assignment Logic**:
   - If `assign_to_copilot` is `true` AND Copilot is detected → assigns to Copilot
   - If `assign_to_copilot` is `true` BUT Copilot is NOT detected → falls back to `fallback_assignee` (if provided)
   - If no fallback is provided → creates unassigned issue

3. **Fallback Configuration**: Use the `fallback_assignee` input to specify a GitHub username that will receive issues when Copilot is unavailable:

```yaml
with:
  assign_to_copilot: 'true'
  copilot_agent: 'copilot'
  fallback_assignee: 'security-team'  # Receives issues if Copilot unavailable
```

### Benefits

- **Reliability**: Issues always get assigned even if Copilot is temporarily unavailable
- **Flexibility**: Easily configure backup assignees for your team
- **No Errors**: Prevents workflow failures due to invalid assignee usernames


## 📝 Issue Format

Created issues include:

- **Package details**: Name and current version
- **CVE identifier**: Official vulnerability ID
- **Severity level**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- **Recommended action**: Specific version upgrades or fixes
- **Provenance**: Link to original scan results

## 🔐 Permissions

The action requires the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read      # To checkout code
  issues: write       # To create and assign issues
```
